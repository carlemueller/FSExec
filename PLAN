1) sequential processing mode (flow + step) <-- DONE
   - working dir 
2) environment / input / input arguments
3) flow control (stop)
4) error / finally
5) output routing
6) cleanup




- problem: specifying fsexec directories and launch args in single cmd line
 - first arg is json?
 - no, have unique flags for them and filter them out


- problem: gluing inputs/outputs
  - provide a dynamic mechanism to provide arguments between steps
    - hm that would only work in sequential processing 
  
- error model
  - already are capturing output streams
  - capture error codes in sequential mode
- restart ability in midpoint
- jumps / conditional jumps
 
 
- do we do a shared context?
